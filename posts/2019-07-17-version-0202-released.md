title: "Version 0.20.2 released"
author: The Nim Team
tags: nim, python, markdown


The Nim team is happy to announce version 0.20.2, which is our second
release candidate for version 1.0.

To read more about version 0.20 and our plans for version 1.0 and beyond,
check the [previous release notes](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2019/06/06/version-0200-released.html).
This is mostly a bugfix release of version 0.20.0 (1.0 RC1).

The only new feature is that `toOpenArray`, our slicing operator,
is now available for the JavaScript backend.

Although this release comes only one month after a previous release,
it has over 200 new commits, fixing over 70 reported issues and bringing
lots of improvements which should make Nim even more stable.


### Style checks

Since version 0.20.0 we improved our style checker to the point that
Nim now bootstraps with `--styleCheck:error` flag, meaning that the compiler
and the standard library are now style checked and they won't compile if
different styles (e.g. `fooBar` and `foo_bar`) are used.

If you would like to only style check your own nimble package, but not its
dependencies, you can use `--styleCheck:hint`, making your package consistent
while still retaining perfect interoperability with all other Nim code in the wild.


### Nimpretty

One of the areas which we focused on for this release is our `nimpretty` tool --
it is a Nim source code beautifier, to format code according to the official
style guide ([NEP-1](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nep1.html)).
More than 30 commits were made aiming to improve `nimpretty` experience and
to make it more robust for real-world scenarios.
Nimpretty version 0.2 ships with Nim, and we invite you to give it a try.


### New runtime

The new runtime is progressing nicely but it is off the critical path for
version 1.0 as it's an opt-in feature.
The next significant milestone is to make the new runtime work with `async`.
Only after this is accomplished we can push for more adoption of it.



## Installing 0.20.2

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using ``choosenim``,
getting Nim 0.20.2 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can get ``choosenim`` by following
[these instructions](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim) or you can install
Nim by following the instructions on our
[install](https://nim-lang.org/install.html) page.




## Changes affecting backwards compatibility

- All `strutils.rfind` procs now take `start` and `last` like `strutils.find`
  with the same data slice/index meaning. This is backwards compatible for
  calls *not* changing the `rfind` `start` parameter from its default. (#11487)

  In the unlikely case that you were using `rfind X, start=N`, or `rfind X, N`,
  then you need to change that to `rfind X, last=N` or `rfind X, 0, N`. (This
  should minimize gotchas porting code from other languages like Python or C++.)

- On Windows stderr/stdout/stdin are not opened as binary files anymore. Use the switch
  `-d:nimBinaryStdFiles` for a transition period.

### Breaking changes in the standard library

- Mac OS X / BSD: TSa_Family is now the ``uint8`` type, so type
  conversions like ``x.sin_family = uint16 toInt(nativesockets.AF_INET)``
  need to be changed into ``x.sin_family = TSa_Family toInt(nativesockets.AF_INET)``.



## Library additions

- `toOpenArray` is now available for the JS target.


## Library changes

- More informative error message for `streams.openFileStream`. (#11438)


## Compiler changes
