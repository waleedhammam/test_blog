It has now been two months since we began our
[BountySource fundraiser](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/nim). We
promised to create a "Current sponsors" page and are happy to announce that
it is now live [here](http://nim-lang.org/sponsors.html).

We are happy to say that last month we raised more than in the previous month!
A staggering $862 was raised during that month and we thank each and every one
of you once again for your generous contributions.

We are gearing up for a brand new release of Nim that includes many bug fixes
and some new features. In the meantime, as always, feel free to get in
touch with us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nim_lang), the
[#nim channel on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=nim)
or via email at contact@nim-lang.org.

Thanks for reading!
