The Nim team is happy to announce that the latest release of Nim,
version 0.19.6, is now available. Nim is a systems programming language that
focuses on performance, portability and expressiveness.

This is the third bugfix release of version 0.19.
There are no breaking changes.
The most important bugfixes are:

- Boolean logic at compile time is now correct.
- Bitwise operations on signed integers in VM are fixed.
- Fixed object self-assignment order of evaluation.
- Compiler no longer crashes with generic types and static generic parameters.
- Fixed raising generic exceptions.


## Installing 0.19.6

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using ``choosenim``,
getting Nim 0.19.6 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update stable
```

If you don't have it already, you can get ``choosenim`` by following
[these instructions](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim) or you can install
Nim by following the instructions on our
[install](https://nim-lang.org/install.html) page.
