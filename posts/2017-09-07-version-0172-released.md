The Nim team is happy to announce that the latest release of Nim,
version 0.17.2, is now available. Nim is a systems programming language that
focuses on performance, portability and expressiveness.

The major new feature in this release is the support for ``.nimble-link`` files.
This has been added in order to support the latest Nimble version with its "develop" feature. For more information, see [``nimble``](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#nimble-develop).

This is however primarily a bug fix release, with the most important bugfixes
including the long standing codegen bugs that triggered GC crashes.
Updating is recommended!

Be sure to check out the changelog [below](#changelog) for
a comprehensive list of changes.

This release also includes version 0.8.8 of the Nimble package manager,
be sure to check out its
[changelog](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/blob/master/changelog.markdown)
for a list of changes since its last release.

You can download the latest release of Nim from the [download](download.html)
page. If you're using [``choosenim``](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim)
then you can easily update to the latest version by running the following:
