title: "Version 0.15.0 released"
author: [Dominik Picheta, Andreas Rumpf]
tags: nim, python
---

We're happy to announce that the latest release of Nim, version 0.15.0, is now
available!

As always, you can grab the latest version from the
[downloads page]({{ site.baseurl }}/install.html).

This release includes almost 180 bug fixes and improvements. To see a full list
of changes, take a look at the detailed changelog
[below](#changelog).

Some of the most significant changes in this release include: improvements to
the documentation, addition of a new ``multisync`` macro, and a new
``HttpClient`` implementation.

## Documentation

All pages in the documentation now contain a search box and a drop down to
select how procedures should be sorted. This allows you to search for
procedures, types, macros and more from any documentation page.

  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/news/images/0.15.0/doc_search.gif" alt="Doc search" style="width:100%"/>
</a>

Sorting the procedures by type shows a more natural table of contents. This
should also help you to find procedures and other identifiers.

</a>

## Multisync macro

The ``multisync`` macro was implemented to enable you to define both
synchronous and asynchronous IO procedures without having to duplicate a
lot of code.

As an example, consider the ``recvTwice`` procedure below:

```nim
proc recvTwice(socket: Socket | AsyncSocket): Future[string] {.multisync.} =
  result = ""
  result.add(await socket.recv(25))
  result.add(await socket.recv(20))
```

The ``multisync`` macro will transform this procedure into the following:

```nim
proc recvTwice(socket: Socket): string =
  result = ""
  result.add(socket.recv(25))
  result.add(socket.recv(20))

proc recvTwice(socket: AsyncSocket): Future[string] {.async.} =
  result = ""
  result.add(await socket.recv(25))
  result.add(await socket.recv(20))
```

Allowing you to use ``recvTwice`` with both synchronous and asynchronous sockets.

## HttpClient

Many of the ``httpclient`` module's procedures have been deprecated in
favour of a new implementation using the ``multisync`` macro. There are now
two types: ``HttpClient`` and ``AsyncHttpClient``. Both of these implement the
same procedures and functionality, the only difference is timeout support and
whether they are blocking or not.

See the [httpclient](http://nim-lang.org/docs/httpclient.html) module
documentation for more information.

## Changelog

### Changes affecting backwards compatibility

- The ``json`` module now uses an ``OrderedTable`` rather than a ``Table``
  for JSON objects.

- The [`split`` `(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/strutils.html#split,string,set[char],int)
  procedure in the ``strutils`` module (with a delimiter of type
  ``set[char]``) no longer strips and splits characters out of the target string
  by the entire set of characters. Instead, it now behaves in a
  similar fashion to ``split`` with ``string`` and ``char``
  delimiters. Use ``splitWhitespace`` to get the old behaviour.

- The command invocation syntax will soon apply to open brackets
  and curlies too. This means that code like ``a [i]`` will be
  interpreted as ``a([i])`` and not as ``a[i]`` anymore. Likewise
  ``f (a, b)`` means that the tuple ``(a, b)`` is passed to ``f``.
  The compiler produces a warning for ``a [i]``::

    Warning: a [b] will be parsed as command syntax; spacing is deprecated

  See [Issue #3898](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/3898) for the
  relevant discussion.

- Overloading the special operators ``.``, ``.()``, ``.=``, ``()`` now
  needs to be enabled via the ``{.experimental.}`` pragma.

- ``immediate`` templates and macros are now deprecated.
  Use ``untyped`` [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#templates-typed-vs-untyped-parameters)
  parameters instead.

- The metatype ``expr`` is deprecated. Use ``untyped``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#templates-typed-vs-untyped-parameters) instead.

- The metatype ``stmt`` is deprecated. Use ``typed``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#templates-typed-vs-untyped-parameters) instead.

- The compiler is now more picky when it comes to ``tuple`` types. The
  following code used to compile, now it's rejected:

  ```nim
  import tables
  var rocketaims = initOrderedTable[string, Table[tuple[k: int8, v: int8], int64]]()
  rocketaims["hi"] = {(-1.int8, 0.int8): 0.int64}.toTable()
  ```

  Instead be consistent in your tuple usage and use tuple names for named tuples:

  ```nim
  import tables
  var rocketaims = initOrderedTable[string, Table[tuple[k: int8, v: int8], int64]]()
  rocketaims["hi"] = {(k: -1.int8, v: 0.int8): 0.int64}.toTable()
  ```

- Now when you compile console applications for Windows, console output
  encoding is automatically set to UTF-8.

- Unhandled exceptions in JavaScript are now thrown regardless of whether
  ``noUnhandledHandler`` is defined. But the stack traces should be much more
  readable now.

- In JavaScript, the ``system.alert`` procedure has been deprecated.
  Use ``dom.alert`` instead.

- De-deprecated ``re.nim`` because there is too much code using it
  and it got the basic API right.

- The type of ``headers`` field in the ``AsyncHttpClient`` type
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/httpclient.html#AsyncHttpClient)
  has been changed
  from a string table to the specialised ``HttpHeaders`` type.

- The ``httpclient.request``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/httpclient.html#request,AsyncHttpClient,string,string,string)
  procedure which takes the ``httpMethod`` as a string
  value no longer requires it to be prefixed with ``"http"``
  (or similar).

- Converting a ``HttpMethod``
  [(doc)](nim-lang.org/docs/httpcore.html#HttpMethod)
  value to a string using the ``$`` operator will
  give string values without the ``"Http"`` prefix now.

- The ``Request``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/asynchttpserver.html#Request)
  object defined in the ``asynchttpserver`` module now uses
  the ``HttpMethod`` type for the request method.

### Library Additions

- Added ``readHeaderRow`` and ``rowEntry`` to the ``parsecsv``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/parsecsv.html) module
  to provide
  a lightweight alternative to python's ``csv.DictReader``.

- Added ``setStdIoUnbuffered`` proc to the ``system`` module to enable
  unbuffered I/O.

- Added ``center`` and ``rsplit`` to the ``strutils``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/strutils.html) module
  to provide similar Python functionality for Nim's strings.

- Added ``isTitle``, ``title``, ``swapCase``, ``isUpper``, ``toUpper``,
  ``isLower``, ``toLower``, ``isAlpha``, ``isSpace``, and ``capitalize``
  to the ``unicode.nim``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/unicode.html) module
  to provide unicode aware case manipulation and case
  testing.

- Added a new module ``strmisc``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/strmisc.html)
  to hold uncommon string
  operations. Currently contains ``partition``, ``rpartition``
  and ``expandTabs``.

- Split out ``walkFiles`` in the ``os``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/os.html) module to three separate procs
  in order to make a clear distinction of functionality. ``walkPattern`` iterates
  over both files and directories, while ``walkFiles`` now only iterates
  over files and ``walkDirs`` only iterates over directories.

- Added a synchronous ``HttpClient`` in the ``httpclient``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/httpclient.html)
  module. The old
  ``get``, ``post`` and similar procedures are now deprecated in favour of it.

- Added a new macro called ``multisync`` allowing you to write procedures for
  synchronous and asynchronous sockets with no duplication.

- The ``async`` macro will now complete ``FutureVar[T]`` parameters
  automatically unless they have been completed already.

### Tool Additions

- The documentation is now searchable and sortable by type.
- Pragmas are now hidden by default in the documentation to reduce noise.
- Edit links are now present in the documentation.


### Compiler Additions

- The ``-d/--define`` flag can now optionally take a value to be used
  by code at compile time.
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#implementation-specific-pragmas-compile-time-define-pragmas)

### Nimscript Additions

- It's possible to enable and disable specific hints and warnings in
  Nimscript via the ``warning`` and ``hint`` procedures.

- Nimscript exports  a proc named ``patchFile`` which can be used to
  patch modules or include files for different Nimble packages, including
  the ``stdlib`` package.

### Language Additions

- Added ``{.intdefine.}`` and ``{.strdefine.}`` macros to make use of
  (optional) compile time defines.
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#implementation-specific-pragmas-compile-time-define-pragmas)

- If the first statement is an ``import system`` statement then ``system``
  is not imported implicitly anymore. This allows for code like
  ``import system except echo`` or ``from system import nil``.
