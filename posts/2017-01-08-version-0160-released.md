We're happy to announce that the latest release of Nim, version 0.16.0, is now
available!

As always, you can grab the latest version from the
[downloads page]({{site.baseurl}}/install.html).

This release includes over 80 bug fixes and improvements. To see a full list
of changes, take a look at the detailed changelog
[below](#changelog).

Some of the most significant changes in this release include: a major new
Nimble release, an improved import syntax, and the stabilisation of
name mangling rules enabling faster compile times.

The new Nimble release that is included with Nim 0.16.0 includes a variety of
new features and bug fixes. The most prominent of which is the improved output
system, as shown in the figure below.

For a full list of changes in Nimble, see its
[changelog](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/blob/master/changelog.markdown#080---05012017).

The new import syntax makes it easier to import multiple modules from the same
package or directory. For example:

```nim
import compiler/ast, compiler/parser, compiler/lexer
import compiler / [ast, parser, lexer]
```

The two are equivalent, but the new latter syntax is less redundant.

Finally, the code responsible for name mangling in the generated C and C++ code
has been improved to reduce compile times. In particular, compile-time for
the common edit-compile-run cycles have been reduced.

# Changelog

## Changes affecting backwards compatibility


- ``staticExec`` now uses the directory of the nim file that contains the
  ``staticExec`` call as the current working directory.
- ``TimeInfo.tzname`` has been removed from ``times`` module because it was
  broken. Because of this, the option ``"ZZZ"`` will no longer work in format
  strings for formatting and parsing.

## Library Additions

- Added new parameter to ``error`` proc of ``macro`` module to provide better
  error message
- Added new ``deques`` module intended to replace ``queues``.
  ``deques`` provides a superset of ``queues`` API with clear naming.
  ``queues`` module is now deprecated and will be removed in the future.

- Added ``hideCursor``, ``showCursor``, ``terminalWidth``,
  ``terminalWidthIoctl`` and ``terminalSize`` to the ``terminal``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/terminal.html) module.

- Added new module ``distros``
  [(doc)](http://nim-lang.org/docs/distros.html)  that can be used in Nimble
  packages to aid in supporting the OS's native package managers.


## Tool Additions


## Compiler Additions


- The C/C++ code generator has been rewritten to use stable
  name mangling rules. This means that compile times for
  edit-compile-run cycles are much reduced.


## Language Additions


- The ``emit`` pragma now takes a list of Nim expressions instead
  of a single string literal. This list can easily contain non-strings
  like template parameters. This means ``emit`` works out of the
  box with templates and no new quoting rules needed to be introduced.
  The old way with backtick quoting is still supported but will be
  deprecated.

  ```nim
  type Vector* {.importcpp: "std::vector", header: "<vector>".}[T] = object

  template `[]=`*[T](v: var Vector[T], key: int, val: T) =
    {.emit: [v, "[", key, "] = ", val, ";"].}

  proc setLen*[T](v: var Vector[T]; size: int) {.importcpp: "resize", nodecl.}
  proc `[]`*[T](v: var Vector[T], key: int): T {.importcpp: "(#[#])", nodecl.}

  proc main =
    var v: Vector[float]
    v.setLen 1
    v[0] = 6.0
    echo v[0]
  ```

- The ``import`` statement now supports importing multiple modules from
  the same directory:

  ```nim
  import compiler / [ast, parser, lexer]
  ```

  Is a shortcut for:

  ```nim
  import compiler / ast, compiler / parser, compiler / lexer
  ```
