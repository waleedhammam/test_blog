title: "Version 0.17.0 released"
author: The Nim Team
tags: nim, python
---

The Nim team is happy to announce that the latest release of Nim,
version 0.17.0, is now available. Nim is a systems programming language that
focuses on performance, portability and expressiveness.

This release fixes the most important regressions introduced in version 0.16.0.
In particular memory manager and channel bugs have been fixed. There was also
many significant improvements to the language, in particular a lot of work was
put into concepts. Zahary has been leading this effort and we thank him for
his hard work. Be sure to check out the changelog [below](#changelog) for
a comprehensive list of changes.

The NSIS based
installer is not provided anymore as the Nim website moved to ``https`` and
this caused NSIS downloads to fail. The latest version of Nim for Windows can
still be downloaded as a zip archive from the
[downloads page]({{site.baseurl}}/install.html).

We would also like to invite you to test a brand new tool that aims to make
the installation and management of multiple Nim versions much easier. This tool
is called ``choosenim`` and allows you to install the latest version of Nim
with a single command.
Check out the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim#installation)
on GitHub to give it a go, but keep in mind that this tool is still
experimental.

This release also includes version 0.8.6 of the Nimble package manager,
be sure to check out its
[changelog](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/blob/master/changelog.markdown)
for a list of changes since its last release.

# Changelog

## Changes affecting backwards compatibility

- There are now two different HTTP response types, ``Response`` and
  ``AsyncResponse``. ``AsyncResponse``'s ``body`` accessor returns a
  ``Future[string]``!

  Due to this change you may need to add another ``await`` in your code.
- ``httpclient.request`` now respects the ``maxRedirects`` option. Previously
  redirects were handled only by ``get`` and ``post`` procs.
- The IO routines now raise ``EOFError`` for the "end of file" condition.
  ``EOFError`` is a subtype of ``IOError`` and so it's easier to distinguish
  between "error during read" and "error due to EOF".
- A hash procedure has been added for ``cstring`` type in ``hashes`` module.
  Previously, hash of a ``cstring`` would be calculated as a hash of the
  pointer. Now the hash is calculated from the contents of the string, assuming
  ``cstring`` is a null-terminated string. Equal ``string`` and ``cstring``
  values produce an equal hash value.
- Macros accepting `varargs` arguments will now receive a node having the
  `nkArgList` node kind. Previous code expecting the node kind to be `nkBracket`
  may have to be updated.
- ``memfiles.open`` now closes file handles/fds by default.  Passing
  ``allowRemap=true`` to ``memfiles.open`` recovers the old behavior.  The old
  behavior is only needed to call ``mapMem`` on the resulting ``MemFile``.
- ``posix.nim``: For better C++ interop the field
  ``sa_sigaction*: proc (x: cint, y: var SigInfo, z: pointer) {.noconv.}`` was
  changed
  to ``sa_sigaction*: proc (x: cint, y: ptr SigInfo, z: pointer) {.noconv.}``.
- The compiler doesn't infer effects for ``.base`` methods anymore. This means
  you need to annotate them with ``.gcsafe`` or similar to clearly declare
  upfront every implementation needs to fulfill these contracts.
- ``system.getAst templateCall(x, y)`` now typechecks the ``templateCall``
  properly. You need to patch your code accordingly.
- ``macros.getType`` and ``macros.getTypeImpl`` for an enum will now return an
  AST that is the same as what is used to define an enum.  Previously the AST
  returned had a repeated ``EnumTy`` node and was missing the initial pragma
  node (which is currently empty for an enum).
- ``macros.getTypeImpl`` now correctly returns the implementation for a symbol
  of type ``tyGenericBody``.
- If the dispatcher parameter's value used in multi method is ``nil``,
  a ``NilError`` exception is raised. The old behavior was that the method
  would be a ``nop`` then.
- ``posix.nim``: the family of ``ntohs`` procs now takes unsigned integers
  instead of signed integers.
- In Nim identifiers en-dash (Unicode point U+2013) is not an alias for the
  underscore anymore. Use underscores instead.
- When the ``requiresInit`` pragma is applied to a record type, future versions
  of Nim will also require you to initialize all the fields of the type during
  object construction. For now, only a warning will be produced.
- The Object construction syntax now performs a number of additional safety
  checks. When fields within case objects are initialized, the compiler will
  now demand that the respective discriminator field has a matching known
  compile-time value.
- On posix, the results of `waitForExit`, `peekExitCode`, `execCmd` will return
  128 + signal number if the application terminates via signal.
- ``ospaths.getConfigDir`` now conforms to the XDG Base Directory specification
  on non-Windows OSs. It returns the value of the ``XDG_CONFIG_DIR`` environment
  variable if it is set, and returns the default configuration directory,
  "~/.config/", otherwise.
- Renamed the line info node parameter for ``newNimNode`` procedure.
- The parsing rules of ``do`` changed.

    ```nim
    foo bar do:
      baz
    ```

  Used to be parsed as:

    ```nim
    foo(bar(do:
      baz))
    ```

  Now it is parsed as:

    ```nim
    foo(bar, do:
      baz)
    ```


Library Additions
-----------------

- Added ``system.onThreadDestruction``.

- Added ``dial`` procedure to networking modules: ``net``, ``asyncdispatch``,
  ``asyncnet``. It merges socket creation, address resolution, and connection
  into single step. When using ``dial``, you don't have to worry about the
  IPv4 vs IPv6 problem. ``httpclient`` now supports IPv6.

- Added `to` macro which allows JSON to be unmarshalled into a type.

    ```nim
    import json

    type
      Person = object
        name: string
        age: int

    let data = """
      {
        "name": "Amy",
        "age": 4
      }
    """

    let node = parseJson(data)
    let obj = node.to(Person)
    echo(obj)
    ```

Tool Additions
--------------

- The ``finish`` tool can now download MingW for you should it not find a
  working MingW installation.


Compiler Additions
------------------

- The name mangling rules used by the C code generator changed. Most of the time
  local variables and parameters are not mangled at all anymore. This improves
  the debugging experience.
- The compiler produces explicit name mangling files when ``--debugger:native``
  is enabled. Debuggers can read these ``.ndi`` files in order to improve
  debugging Nim code.


Language Additions
------------------

- The ``try`` statement's ``except`` branches now support the binding of a
caught exception to a variable:

    ```nim
      try:
        raise newException(Exception, "Hello World")
      except Exception as exc:
        echo(exc.msg)
    ```

    This replaces the ``getCurrentException`` and ``getCurrentExceptionMsg()``
    procedures, although these procedures will remain in the stdlib for the
    foreseeable future. This new language feature is actually implemented using
    these procedures.

    In the near future we will be converting all exception types to refs to
    remove the need for the ``newException`` template.

- A new pragma ``.used`` can be used for symbols to prevent
the "declared but not used" warning. More details can be
found [here](http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#pragmas-used-pragma).
- The popular "colon block of statements" syntax is now also supported for
  ``let`` and ``var`` statements and assignments:

    ```nim
    template ve(value, effect): untyped =
      effect
      value

    let x = ve(4):
      echo "welcome to Nim!"
    ```

    This is particularly useful for DSLs that help in tree construction.


## Language changes

- The ``.procvar`` annotation is not required anymore. That doesn't mean you
  can pass ``system.$`` to ``map`` just yet though.
