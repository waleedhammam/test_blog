In just under a week, FOSDEM 2018 will be taking place in Brussels at the
[Universit√© libre de Bruxelles](https://fosdem.org/2018/practical/transportation/).

Come join us in [Building K (level 2)](https://fosdem.org/2018/stands)
where members of our core development
team will be selling t-shirts, copies of the newly published book
[Nim in Action](https://book.picheta.me/), and other goodies.
We will also be giving away flyers and
stickers for free!

We're all excited to meet you and can't wait to introduce everyone to Nim.
If you're around in Brussels on Friday ahead of the event, do join us at the
[beer event](https://fosdem.org/2018/beerevent/) as well.

Be sure to join our brand new
Telegram supergroup if you can't find us or just want to chat, we will be
using it to organise ourselves during the events:
