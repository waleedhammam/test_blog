The Nim team is happy to announce that the latest release of Nim,
version 0.19.4, is now available. Nim is a systems programming language that
focuses on performance, portability and expressiveness.

This is mostly a bugfix release of version 0.19.2.
There are no breaking changes.
The most important bugfixes are:

- The mark&sweep GC had a serious performance regression that has been fixed.
- The produced tarballs now support `koch tests`.
- Json escaping has been fixed.
- The documentation for `async` procs was missing, fixed.

getting Nim 0.19.4 is as easy as:
